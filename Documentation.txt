I worked this app with 2 layers model, due to the app is very simple and doesn't has to many logic.
This app has client layer and service layer.
In client layer We can find all visual components like:
-Character-list.
-Character-card.
-Favourites-list.
-Modal (for comic detail).
-Navbar.


In service layer We can find all http petitions(fetchs) and returned data. Also here We have the interfaces or models for 
type the application with TypeScript.(I don't like use 'any' as type).

Secondly the app meets the plus petitions. These were:
-Aditional function (I made two: Sort and Posibility to remove comic from favourites list).
-Response Application (Works in all common devices perfectly).
-No frameworks or librarys for design (Just use CSS with preprocessor 'SCSS' due to It were the other plus petition).
