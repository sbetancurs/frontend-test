# MarvelComicsApp

This project was made to satisfy the front-end test for an enterprise.

Here u can find all marvel heroes in an ordered list with sort options and search string option (The search string is just for the character name).
Also u will find by each character 4 comics where the character is on. U can click hover the comic and see the details, also add It to favourites list.
Then with the favourites list, u can see all comics and modify the list, adding more or removing the current comics.
## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
